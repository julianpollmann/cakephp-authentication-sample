# CakePHP Simple Authentication Sample


This is a sample project for [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org) 4.x and the [Authentication Plugin](https://github.com/cakephp/authentication).


## Installation

1. Clone this repository :)
2. Download [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) or update `composer self-update`.
3. Run `php composer.phar install` to install all dependencies.

If Composer is installed globally, run

```bash
composer install
```

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start
up the built-in webserver with:

```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765/login` to see the login page, `http://localhost:8765/register` to register a user.
